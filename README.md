# Task.2
# Six.servos

# Servo Motor:
A servo motor is an actuator that can be used to precisely control angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration.

# Equipment List:
Arduino Uno
Servo Motor
Wires
# Experiment Setup:
Connect the servo motor's power wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Connect the servo motor's signal wire to pin 8 on the Arduino.
Connect the servo motor's ground wire to the GND pin on the Arduino.
For additional servo motors, connect their power and ground wires to the 5V and GND pins on the Arduino, respectively, and connect their signal wires to pins 9 through 13 on the Arduino.
